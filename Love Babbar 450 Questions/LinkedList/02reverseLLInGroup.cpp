/*

Given a linked list of size N. The task is to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function) in the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should be considered as a group and must be reversed (See Example 2 for clarification).

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->2->4->5->6->7->8
K = 4
Output: 4 2 2 1 8 7 6 5
